Pseudocode

1) FILE 1: DICTIONARIES
Create dictionaries with endings (noun and verbal)
Key should be the definition and value the ending

2) FILE 2: SENTENCE
User writes sentence (raw_input)

3) Save sentence in variable and split words (list of strings)

4) FILE 3: ANALYZER
Create menu --> Ask user what he/she wants to do (menu function); compare answer with number (if ==) --> call function

5) Import dictionaries from 1) and Import sentence from 2)

6a) Find subject/object/verb:
Go through sentence (for loop) and compare (==) endings (access string -1:-2 or split every word and access list) with endings in dictionaries (values).
If match found, print ÒIn this sentence, the subject/object/verb isÉÓ
If no match found, print: none or not expressed 
(Special case: Plural verb --> one subject in pl. or two subjects)

6b) Analyze word:
- Ask user which word he/she wants to analyze
- if word in list: compare ending with dictionaries
- print
(cfr. 5a!!!)

6c) Analyze sentence (=all words in sentence): do 5a for every word (add if no match), print

PROBLEM: homophone endings

IN THE FUTURE:
- add casus
- add decl
- add adj
- add other tenses (impf., pf.)
- add coordinating conjunctions (et, -que, sed)
